# ðŸ›’ Smart Shopper Insights Dashboard

## Overview
Smart Shopper Insights is a full-stack cloud-based dashboard built on Azure that enables retailers to analyze customer behavior, predict Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), explore basket analysis, and detect churn risks. The project focuses on providing actionable insights into customer engagement and spending trends.

This project demonstrates the ability to build an end-to-end data pipeline with machine learning modeling, cloud deployment, and interactive visualizations using Azure services.
